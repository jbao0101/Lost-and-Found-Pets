# LostAndFoundPetApp

(This is currently a work in progress)

This project is part of the LiftOff portion of LaunchCode, which is essentially LaunchCode's capstone class. This project is the product of an agile environment with a small group.

The goal of this project is to create an app where users can create an account, create postings of lost pets, and browse through said postings to search for lost or found pets. This includes different functionalities such as form/input submission, account creation, google map functionality to find nearby shelters, etc.
